# Political-Compass-Express

This project was a Joint effort with [Raphael Zwein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rapha%C3%ABl-zwein-709906213/). It was made out of the idea of doing a simpler version of
[The political Compass](https://politicalcompass.org/).
The idea is that by responding to 8 tendencies and it permits to quickly triage people for debates.
